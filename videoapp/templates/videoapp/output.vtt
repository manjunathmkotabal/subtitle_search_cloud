21:13.203 --> 21:17.074
I’D LOVE TO HANG OUT
WITH YOU GUYS, BUT...

21:17.074 --> 21:19.944
YOU MIND IF
I BRING A FRIEND?

21:21.044 --> 21:25.882
[RIM SHOT]IT’S ALL YOUR FAULT,
KRONK.

21:21.044 --> 21:25.882
I TOLD YOU WE SHOULD
HAVE TURNED HIM
INTO A HIPPO.

21:25.883 --> 21:28.386

21:28.385 --> 21:31.054
AND AS YOU CAN SEE,
THE POTION WORE OFF

21:31.054 --> 21:33.523
AND I’M BACK TO MY
HANDSOME HUMAN SELF.

21:33.523 --> 21:35.859
\h\h\h\hTHOUGH I DO HAVE
A CRAVING FOR CARROTS.

21:35.859 --> 21:39.963

21:39.963 --> 21:42.899

AS FOR KRONK, WELL,
TO MAKE UP FOR HIS MISTAKE,

21:45.903 --> 21:48.439
HE BAKED YZMA SOME OF
HIS FAVORITE SPINACH PUFFS.

21:48.438 --> 21:51.841
WHAT YZMA DOESN’T KNOW
IS I SWITCHED THOSE
SPINACH PUFFS

21:51.842 --> 21:54.845

22:20.337 --> 22:22.973

A CHANCE TO ASK YOU--

22:24.608 --> 22:26.443
WHAT?UH...

22:24.608 --> 22:29.613

"SCROLL" NOT "SQUIRREL."

22:29.613 --> 22:30.881
PROPS!
